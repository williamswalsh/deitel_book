javac -g App.java        Generates debug info required by debugger
-g:vars                  Generates a local var table in the .class file

jdb                      Start|Restart debugger

stop at App:3            Add breakpoint in class App at line 3

run App                  Execute App class with debugger

cont                     Continue execution after after reaching a breakpoint

print <var>              Print variable value at breakpoint

print <expression>       Print expression value at breakpoint
print x*x*y              <int>
print x == 23            true|false

set <var> = 23           Change variables value at a breakpoint

clear                    Lists all breakpoints
clear App:3              Remove breakpoint

watch App.x              debugger notifies you b4 value is changed, enters breakpoint b4 change NB

unwatch App.x            reverts watch

step                     Executes line by line
                         Step into method calls

step up                  Step out of method call code to caller


next                     Like step but skips method call code

exit                     Terminates execution - doesn't complete code
