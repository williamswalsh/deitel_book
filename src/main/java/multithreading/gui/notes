Swing apps have a single thread
-> Event Dispatcher Thread
-> Updates GUI & processes user input
-> UI interaction events are added to an eventQ -> executed sequentially
-> Swing components are not thread safe

Thread Confinement
-> Removing multi-threading
-> Used with non-thread safe objects
-> Limit the number of threads to 1

SwingWorker implements runnable
