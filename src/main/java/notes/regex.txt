Quantifier:
-----------
? -> 0 or 1
* -> 0 or many -> will match an empty string
+ -> 1 or many
{n} -> n times
{n,} ->  at least n times
{n, m} -> n to m times

Quantifiers are "greedy" by design
-> They will match as many characters as possible
-> If you use ? -> they are "reluctant"


String.matches()
-> doesn't match sub-strings
-> must match complete strings
