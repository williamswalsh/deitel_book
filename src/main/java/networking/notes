Networking:
-----------
Internet -> Inter-network -> Network of Networks
Web      -> Content which is accessed via internet

Java offers:

Stream-based Communication
-> Connection Oriented protocol
-> TCP
-> Stream-Sockets
-> Better reliability, less performant

Packet-based Communication
-> Connectionless protocol
-> UDP
-> Transmitting Individual packets
-> Datagram-Sockets
-> Packets can be lost and/or duplicated
-> Packets don't arrive in any particular order
-> Better performance, worse reliability

Socket:
-> Software construct
-> Allows apps to view networking as if it was file I/O
-> read() write()

Multi-casting:
Clients can subscribe to Server cast
Server can publish info -> All subscribers receive it


URI -> Uniform Resource Identifier
URL -> Uniform Resource Locator
URL is a URI which refers to the locations of a web page.


Swing UI Lib:
event.getActionCommand() -> Returns a components associated string(this data is recorded in the event)
JEditorPane.setPage(String url) -> handles the connection to the server
-> Useful for displaying text within a JFrame(Window)
-> Generates a HyperlinkEvent when a hyperlink is moused-on, moused-off and clicked
-> HyperlinkListener to perform an action when this occurs(browse to new page)
-> EventType .ENTERED
-> EventType .EXITED
-> EventType .ACTIVATED


ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket( port, maxClientQueueLength);
-> Registers available TPC port
-> Specifies the max number of clients ?
