Requirements Doc
- WHAT is the system supposed to do

Design Spec
- HOW does the system fulfill its requirements

System Structure
- Describes the systems objects & describes their interrelationships

System Behaviour
- Describes how the system changes


Diagrams:
1) Use Case -> actors + their uses
2) Activity -> Actions performed and the order of those actions
3) Sequence -> Interactions + when they occur
4) Class -> Structural relationships between "pseudo-classes"
5) Communication -> what interactions occur
6) State machine -> Objects state changes


Class Diagrams:
Association
-> line

Composition
-> line with solid diamond
-> has-a relationship
-> Whole & part
-> Solid Diamond on whole container side
-> Whole creates the parts
-> Rule: Part exist only if whole does
-> Rule: Can only belong to one whole at a time

Aggregation
->
 line with hollow diamond
-> Aggregation
-> Same part can be part of many wholes
-> Part can exist independently without whole




State Diagram
-> Sequence of states
-> Whats states can the system be in
-> What events cause states to change

Activity
-> Sequence of events/actions
-> Workflow
-> The actions an object will perform in what order
